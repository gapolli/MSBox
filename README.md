ST001 project that is taught at the Unicamp School of Technology (FT). The project consists of queries to databases that are on the Internet - primarily in HTML format - and database queries that are in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format. First, an RDF Turtle file is generated containing the crawled web data, and then the existing ontologies and features are added to this file.
